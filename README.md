# Bookmarklets
Collection of bookmarklets
Thats all :)
(NOTE: I CLAIM NO OWNERSHIP OF THIS CODE. IT IS SIMPLY A COLLECTION OF BOOKMARKLETS I FOUND FUN/USEFULL)

EXT REMOVER
Bookmarklet exploit that can force-disable any extension installed on Google Chrome

Instructions
Here are the instructions to using this exploit! There are two ways, using the GUI and using the ids, the GUI method is better

Using the GUI
Credit to CompactCow#4717 for the amazing UI!

Go to the file gui.js and copy everything and create a new bookmark and use the code you copied as the Page URL
Visit https://chrome.google.com/webstorex. (This is a 404 page, and that is ok.)
Click the bookmark (Make sure you are on the page above!)
Use the menu to toggle your extensions!
