# Bookmarklets
Collection of bookmarklets
Thats all :)
(NOTE: I wrote almost none of these, and I took most of them from a bookmarks bar so I've got no idea who the OG authors are) 

# Force remove ext

Bookmarklet exploit that can force-disable any extension installed on Google Chrome

Instructions

Go to the file gui.js and copy everything and create a new bookmark and use the code you copied as the Page URL
Visit https://chrome.google.com/webstorex. (This is a 404 page, and that is ok.)
Click the bookmark (Make sure you are on the page above!)
Use the menu to toggle your extensions!

(credit goes to 3kh0 for the ext remover)
