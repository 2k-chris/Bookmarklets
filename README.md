(NOTE: I wrote almost none of these, and I took most of them from a bookmarks bar so I've got no idea who the OG authors are) 

# Force remove ext

Bookmarklet exploit that can force-disable any extension installed on Google Chrome

Instructions

Here are the instructions to using this exploit! There are two ways, using the GUI and using the ids, the GUI method is better

Using the GUI

Credit to CompactCow#4717 for the amazing UI!

Go to the file gui.js and copy everything and create a new bookmark and use the code you copied as the Page URL
Visit https://chrome.google.com/webstorex. (This is a 404 page, and that is ok.)
Click the bookmark (Make sure you are on the page above!)
Use the menu to toggle your extensions!
